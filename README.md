### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my GitHub profile

My name is Erick Omondi, and I am a Front End Developer Trainee. 

I am currently in the process of learning web development and honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I am passionate about creating beautiful, user-friendly websites and applications. Additionally, I am able to create static websites, dynamic, responsive designs, and interactive elements.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer and to work on large-scale projects that push the boundaries of web design and development.

This GitHub profile serves as a portfolio of my work and accomplishments. Feel free to browse through my repositories and read about the projects I have been working on. 

Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
