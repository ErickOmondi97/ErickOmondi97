### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Welcome to my GitHub profile

My name is Erick Omondi, and I am a Front End Developer Trainee. 

I am currently in the process of learning web development and honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I am passionate about creating beautiful, user-friendly websites and applications, and my goal is to become a full-time Front End Developer. 

This GitHub profile serves as a portfolio of my work and accomplishments. Feel free to browse through my repositories and read about the projects I have been working on. 

Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to hearing from you soon! 

Cheers, 
Erick Omondi
